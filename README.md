# Covid19 Ventilator

## Disclaimer
This project is a proof-of-concept. It was made in collaboration with the East Nile Hospital in Sudan to assist manual ventilators used during the pandemic. The project was never released and it's only here for educational purposes

## Overview

This project leverages a simple Arduino controller to automate a manual ventilator, providing a cost-effective solution to aid in respiratory support.

## Features

- **Automation**: Converts a manual ventilator into an automated system.
- **Simple Hardware**: Utilizes a basic Arduino controller.
- **Cost-Effective**: Designed to be an affordable solution in resource-limited settings.
- **Open Source**: Free for anyone to use, modify, and improve upon.

## Components

- Arduino Uno (or any compatible Arduino controller)
- Manual ventilator (ambu bag)
- Servo motor
- Power supply (battery or USB)
- Basic electronic components (wires, resistors, etc.)

## How It Works

The Arduino controller is programmed to control the servo motor, which in turn compresses and decompresses the manual ventilator at regular intervals. This automated process provides consistent and reliable ventilation support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Basic knowledge of electronics and Arduino programming

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mastagoon/arduino-ventilator
   cd arduino-ventilator
   ```
2. **Upload the Code to Arduino**
    - Connect your Arduino to your computer.
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Load the ventilator.ino file from the cloned repository. Use the appropriate .ini for your arduino model
